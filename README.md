# Introduction
Shaaft is a three-dimensional block stacking game. The blocks fall into a shaft (also known as the pit). The aim of the game is to complete planes (instead of rows). Incomplete layers cause the blocks to build up and reduce the available space. The game ends when some blocks no longer fit into the shaft.

# Scoring

Points are given when a block is locked. Its visual representation changes from the outline (which you can move and rotate) to the solid elements that accumulate at the bottom of the shaft.

The number of points is dependent on the number of elements in a block, the block's complexity, as well as the current level. Dropping a block earlier (using SPACE) results in  more points as well.

When a plane is completed (and disappears) additional points are given out. Completing multiple planes at a time gives more points.

The 20 seconds following a Moo-Hachoo all points scored are doubled.
